# 1. What question are you trying to answer?
When is it worth it to use a rideshare service?
("worth it" is subjective, so I'll be focusing on getting the most value for money spent)

# 2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.
I don't own a car, so my main modes of transportation are either walking, public transit, or calling an uber. Calling an uber is the most convenient but also the most expensive, which is why I'd like to get a better understanding of the different variables that affect cost.

# 3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?
I hypothesize that it is worth it to use a rideshare service if your trip is around 2-5 miles long and you're requesting the service around afternoon/late night time. I believe that time and distance are the main factors that affect the price. If your destination is less than 2 miles, then walking is probably a viable option. If your destination far away, then public transportation is most likely cheaper. I also think that requesting rideshare service in the afternoon or late night is better for avoiding traffic, which will make the trip cheaper.

# 4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.

The data is only about rides that occurred in NYC, but I think it is still applicable to my situation since I live in the Bay Area.
